# My Approach 
Before Starting part 1 had cloned the given repository into my device.

## PART-1:
The first part was kinda straight foreward.I found out the Parchment and with the help of git command like cat and was able to get the code.The starting was kinda confusing as it was my first time using terminal.But it was manageble and i was able to successfully complete the part 1.


## Part-2:
To be frank this has to be the most irritating and confusing part of this task.The clues given were literally troubling me and i spent my entire weekend on this watching yt videos and at last was able to do it.Finding the names of herbs was easy but the code deriving was kinda challenging.Got he celestial veil amulet code and was able to switch using checkout function.


## Part-3:
This part was relatively easy for me and i was able to get the codes easily.I used the git checkout function and git branch function to switch between the branches and was able to get both codes from both realms.


## Part-4:
I used the codes that i had collected in the previous tasks and decoded using base64.I was able to get the link to godsuite repo after 2-3 tries as the code from part 2 was a little off.But nevertheless was able to get it.


## Part-5
All the codes together decoded gave me the link of the GodSuite Repo .From the godsuite repo using cat ,commit and checkout function was able to get into another repo https://github.com/angrezichatterbox/To-the-stars-and-realms-unseen .This gave me the victory.py file which on running gave the victory message.The screenshot of the victory message is uploaded .


# GIT COMMANDS I USED:

  `git clone <url>`: Clones the repo given using the url to local system.<br/>
  
  `git branch`: It gives the list of all branches present<br/>
  
  `git checkout <branch name>`: It helps in switching between branches<br/>
  
  `git config --global user.name "username"`:It gives the username for git commit<br/>
  
  `git-commit `:It is used to commit changes in the git repo<br/>
  
  `git push`: It pusches contents to remote branch


  

# TERMINAL COMMAND:

`cd <directory_path>`: Helps in changing the directory of the file.<br/>

`ls`: It lists all the currents files in the current directory<br/>

`mkdir <directory_name>`: Used to Create a new directory<br/>

`cat<file_name>`:Used to get all the contents in the file<br/>

`rmdir<directory_name>`:It delets an empty directory<br/>

`touch <file.name>`: Create a new file<br/>
