# Approach

The HTML,CSS,JavaScript files with the basic terminal required for the website and its respective design and commands were provided.I had basic idea about html but css and js were kind of new to me.It took me about a complete week to complete this task.But it was interesting also to see the website coming alive with every single line of code.
With the help of some youtube videos and some websites from the net i was able to proceed with the task and complete to my level best. Many js and css commands were new to me but i managed to learn those in the week and complete it.
I think i could have done more of a design to the webpage but due to time contraints i was unable to do it and i have proceeded with a basic design.
