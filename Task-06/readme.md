VSCodium is a repository exclusively made for open-source binaries of Visual Studio Code that do not bear any marks of Microsoft's ownership, track any user, or have any money-related procedures. It is not a copy of VSCode, but the collection of programs is using the open part of the VSCode to develop an edition that is free to use without spending any money.
